The news room challenge: We have built three clients served by one API.
We built a news paper platform with the user client, the admin client and a user mobile client with React Native.

- [API](https://github.com/mauroavellaneda/api_el_gaucho_nyheter.git)
- [Mobile](https://github.com/mauroavellaneda/mobile_el_gaucho_nyheter.git)
- [Admin](https://github.com/mauroavellaneda/client_admin_el_gaucho_nyheter.git)
- [User](https://github.com/mauroavellaneda/client_user_el_gaucho_nyheter.git)
